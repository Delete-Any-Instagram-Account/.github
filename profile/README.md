### **1.1 Forgetting the Password**

Nobody actually forgets his or her password in Instagram; they are usually not in use for periods of time. It is pretty hard without your **Instagram password** to log into your account and be able to delete it. Such situations become more complicated if the account is not connected to current recovery options like email or phone.

1.2 Loss of Recovery Email Access
Perhaps you changed your main email account or lost access to the email address connected with your Instagram. Well, deleting an Instagram account without an email connection is a bit more difficult, since most password resets depend on access to email. Also, in cases where your recovery email has become outdated or is inaccessible, resetting passwords will be tough.

1.3 Cancellation or Loss of the Subscribing Telephone Number

Other common issues involve phone number changes. If your Instagram account is connected to an older phone number, then this may render any password recovery process useless. Without access to your original phone number, it's impossible to receive security codes and verification texts.
